PingPong

A simple Pong clone created for the Minify Game Jam #1 ( http://minifygamejam.github.io/ )


I used the following tools and assets to make this game:

LÖVE 0.9.0 - 2D game engine; this is needed to run the game. ( http://love2d.org/ )

hump.vector - Vector library for LÖVE, included in the game's repo as "vector.lua". ( http://vrld.github.io/hump/ )

Bfxr - an online sound effects generator. ( http://www.bfxr.net/ )

Inkscape - 2D vector design program ( http://www.inkscape.org/ )

Anonymous Pro - A set of monospaced fonts created by Mark Simonson ( http://www.marksimonson.com/info/anonymous-pro-usage-notes )
